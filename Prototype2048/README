Prototype 2048

2048-game based mechanics where you need to combine food items to get next level items and eventually get a scorepoint.
This prototype was a challenging eye opener how to create and implement prototypes.
It was hard and fun at the same time to learn how you can use only code to get a playable prototype, our assets were added at later stage.
We co-created this prototype with student colleague during our trainee period.

What I learned from this project? 

I learned how to work in Scrum, attending daily meetings, sprint planning, reviews and sprint retrospects.

I learned how to implement features / ideas to a prototype through code only.
Fast prototyping instead of wondering about graphics / assets, these would come at a later stage if game would be fun.

I learned how to adapt MVC model to game dev / prototyping, also gained deeper knowledge about C# basics
(events,for loops, a lot of vectors and arrays, also got familiar with touch input for mobile)

This project was the hardest lesson so far since I got to dive to the deep end immediately.
When we got stuck with something, we first tried to figure it out by ourselves, but when we couldn't solve the problem senior programmers were there to help us.
But in the end, Im proud that we got an playable prototype with fun mechanics.
