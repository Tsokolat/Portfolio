First school project AVA Prologue, 2D Cyberpunk themed platformer.

My roles in the project:
Project leader, programmer, animator, sounds, game design.

What I learned while doing this project:

How to implement feature ideas into game mechanics:
- 3 different melee attacks with sounds and animations 
- Ability to shoot ranged weapon with sound and animation 
- Traps that cause damage to player character
- Different main character animations with different states ( jump,crouch,run)

How to create main menu with animations and background music and how to link buttons to actions / scenes:
- New Game
- Save Game / Load Game
- Exit Game
- Credits

I learned how important time management and clear tasklists are to the project.

I was doing multiple roles in this project, which overloaded my time and efficiency a bit.
We focused too much on having many different mechanics instead of finishing the game,
so we ran out of time to actually finish the project.

Project was a fun and hard lesson into game deveploment.
